# Image-Centric Navigation for Visually Impaired

A web-based navigation solution designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating through image-centric content. This project aims to make images and visual media more accessible, providing an intuitive, voice-guided interface to help visually impaired users understand and interact with visual content.

## Features

- **Image Descriptions**: Automatic generation of detailed descriptions for images and visual content using AI-based image recognition.
- **Voice Guidance**: Integration of text-to-speech functionality to guide users through image elements.
- **Image-based Navigation**: Image elements are navigable via keyboard or gestures, with each section being described in real-time.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust voice speed, language, and image description preferences to suit user needs.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages for both descriptions and voice guidance.
- **Accessible Interface**: A simple, user-friendly interface optimized for screen readers and keyboard navigation.


## Usage

Once the app is up and running, simply upload an image or navigate through the image gallery. The application will automatically detect the image content and provide voice-guided navigation for better accessibility.

- Use the **Tab** key to cycle through interactive elements.
- Press **Enter** to activate or select an item.
- Adjust settings through the options menu to change language, voice speed, or enable/disable specific features.
